# PhasmoPhoto
An application to save your in-game Phasmophobia photos.

Add the Phasmophobia install directory and the directory where you wish to save the photos and click Save Settings.
The interval is the time between PhasmoPhoto checks for new photos.
PhasmoPhoto runs in the background and by default will minimize to the tray when you click the X. 

There is a config file that gets saved automatically to `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\PhasmoPhoto\phasmophoto.config`
